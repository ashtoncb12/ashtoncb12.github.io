## Ashton Blehm's Project Portfolio
Hi! I'm Ashton Blehm, an aspiring data analyst / scientist who is currently a 3rd year Georgia Tech Mathematics student. I am extremely passionate in sports analytics and creating effective data visualizations. What follows is some of my projects that I have completed using data from the [sports reference websites](sports-reference.com). 
<!-- Description <br /> -->

## [Plotting MLB Teams' Histories](https://github.com/ashtoncb12/BaseballStats/tree/main/Wins%20and%20Season%20Result%20by%20Year%20MLB)
Description: Given any team, this code analyzes a team's wins and result for each season, and plots it on a bar chart. <br /> <br />

Objective: Comprehensively demonstrate a team's stretches where they win / lose many years in a row, or have long playoff or title droughts. 

## [NFL Average Points For vs. Points Against](https://github.com/ashtoncb12/NFLStats/tree/main/Points%20Scored%20vs%20Points%20Allowed%20NFL)
Description: Given any season, this code creates a graph that plots every team on a 2D plane based on their average points for and average points against. <br /> <br />

Objective: This graph provides an easy manner of determining which teams had higher/lower than average point statistics relative to other teams. One can also easily observe the ranking of the most powerful offenses and defenses.

## [Animated Graph](https://github.com/ashtoncb12/NFLStats/tree/main/Animated%20Points%20Scored%20vs%20Points%20Against%20NFL)
Description: This program creates an animation of week by week points for and points against data.

Objective: Through the animation it is easier to see week-by-week trends for each team. For example, a team that loses its quarterback in week 6 will likely see a decline in average offensive production in the following weeks, which would be evident in this animation.
